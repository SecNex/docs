# Community of Makers

Each company which uses the Microsoft Power Platform knows how important it is to have a concept for the work of the so-called "makers". The makers are the people who create the applications and solutions with the Power Platform.

## Makers 

All **makers** have different skill levels and different areas of expertise. In big companies, there are often many **makers** who work on different projects or in different departments. The **makers** can be professional developers, but they can also be business users who have no experience in programming with a low-code platform.

It's very important to restrict the access to the Power Platform. Not every user without any knowledge of the Power Platform should be able to create apps or solutions. The **makers** should be trained and certified to ensure that they have the necessary knowledge to create secure and efficient applications.

Your company can provide training for the **makers**. It's recommended to have certification levels for the **makers**. The certification levels can be used to define the skill level of the **makers**.

**Example of certification levels:**

- **Basic Maker:** The **maker** can create simple applications with the Power Platform for personal use.
- **Advanced Maker:** The **maker** can create complex applications with the Power Platform for the company.

## Community

If you work as a first-level support or system administrator, you will often have to deal with the **makers**. The **makers** will ask you for help if they have problems with the Power Platform. It's important to have a good relationship with the **makers**. You should be available to help them and answer their questions.

To relieve the burden on the first-level support, it's recommended to create a community of **makers**. The **makers** can help each other and share their knowledge. The community can be used to discuss problems and solutions. The **makers** can also share their applications and solutions with the community.
