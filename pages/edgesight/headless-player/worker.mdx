# Worker

The worker service is responsible for taking screenshots of the websites and caching them in a local storage. It is based on [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), a library to automate chromium, firefox and webkit browsers. The worker service is designed to be used together with [EdgeSight](https://secnex.io/edgesight), a digital signage solution.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SecNex/edgesight-headless-worker-python.git
cd edgesight-headless-worker-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python app.py [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

- `--noapi`: Disable the API server and run only the headless player with a database connection.
- `--force`: Force a cleanup of the database before starting the application.

### Example

```bash
# Run the headless player with the API server and force a cleanup of the database
python app.py -force

# Run the headless player without the API server and force a cleanup of the database
python app.py --noapi --force
```

## Integrations

The **Headless Player** has by default a lot of integrations with other services. You can use it with [EdgeSight](https://secnex.io/edgesight) to display the screenshots on a digital signage screen. You can also use it with [EdgeSight API](https://secnex.io/edgesight-api) to manage the screenshots and the devices.
But you can show the following services too:

- PowerBI _(Coming soon)_
- Grafana _(Coming soon)_

## Extendaibility

The **Headless Player** is designed to be easily extendable. With the REST API you can create your own integrations with other services. For that, it is necessary to start the worker with the `--noapi` option and create your own API server.
