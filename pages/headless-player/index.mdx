# Headless Player 

**Headless Player** is part of **EdgeSight**, a suite for digital signage. It is a standalone player that can be used to screenshot everything that you can browse on the web. It is a headless browser that can be controlled via a REST API.

## Features

### Content Delegation

You can delegate the content to be displayed on the player to a remote server. This way, you can control the content from a central location. Every player can display different content.

Every player can communicate with the REST API to get the content configuration. The content can be a URL, a locak HTML file or a implemented template or service (e.g. PowerBI).

### Full control

You can control the player complete remotely. Each player will have a unique ID that you can use to control it. So you can configure the viewports, the refresh rate, the content, etc.
