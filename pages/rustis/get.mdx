# GET

Get the value of key. If the key does not exist the special value nil is returned. An error is returned if the value stored at key is not a string, because GET only handles string values.

## Syntax

```bash
GET key
```

## Examples

```bash
redis> GET nonexisting
(nil)
redis> SET mykey "Hello"
"OK"
redis> GET mykey
"Hello"
```
