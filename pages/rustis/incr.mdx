# INCR

Increments the number stored at key by one. If the key does not exist, it is set to 0 before performing the operation. An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a string that can not be represented as integer. This operation is limited to 64 bit signed integers.

## Syntax

```bash
INCR key
```

## Examples

```bash
redis> SET mykey "10"
OK
redis> INCR mykey
(integer) 11
redis> GET mykey
"11"
```
