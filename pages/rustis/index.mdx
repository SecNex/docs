# Rustis

Welcome to the documentation for **Rustis**! This project aims to provide a Redis-like server implemented in Rust, leveraging the power of asynchronous I/O with Tokio and an in-memory database for fast and efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Project Overview

**Rustis** is designed to handle various commands over TCP connections, similar to Redis. It uses Tokio for asynchronous I/O operations and an in-memory database protected by a mutex to ensure data integrity.

## Current development status

The project is currently in the early stages of development. The basic server structure is in place, and the server can handle a few commands. The next steps are to implement more commands and improve the overall performance and stability of the server.
