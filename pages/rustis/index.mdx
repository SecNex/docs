# Rustis

Welcome to the documentation for **Rustis**! This project aims to provide a Redis-like server implemented in Rust, leveraging the power of asynchronous I/O with Tokio and an in-memory database for fast and efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Project Overview

**Rustis** is designed to handle various commands over TCP connections, similar to Redis. It uses Tokio for asynchronous I/O operations and an in-memory database protected by a mutex to ensure data integrity.

### Main Components

1. **Database**:
   - The database is an in-memory [`HashMap`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22HashMap%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") protected by a [`Mutex`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22Mutex%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A1%2C%22character%22%3A21%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
   - Type aliases are used to simplify complex types.

2. **TCP Server**:
   - The server accepts incoming TCP connections and processes commands asynchronously.
   - Uses Tokio for efficient asynchronous I/O operations.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - Supports various commands such as `SET`, `GET`, `EXPIRE`, `TTL`, `INCR`, `DECR`, `EXISTS`, and `USERS`.
   - Each command is processed by its own function or module.

## Installation

To install and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/secnex/rustis.git
   cd rustis
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Architecture

The architecture of **Rustis** is modular to ensure maintainability and extensibility. The main modules are:

- **handler.rs**: Handles incoming TCP connections and processes commands.
- **db/connection.rs**: Manages the database connection and performs database operations.
- **cmd**: Contains the implementations of the various commands.

### Example Code Snippet

Here is an excerpt from [`handler.rs`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fbbenouarets%2FProjects%2Fsecnex%2Frustis%2Fsrc%2Fhandler.rs%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/Users/bbenouarets/Projects/secnex/rustis/src/handler.rs") that demonstrates how the server processes incoming commands:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::time::Instant;
use tokio::net::TcpStream;
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use crate::db::connection::DbConnection;
use crate::cmd::{set, get, expire, ttl, incr, decr, exists};

// Type aliases for the database and value
type Db = Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, DbValue>>>;
type DbValue = (String, Option<Instant>);

pub fn parse_resp_bulk_string(input: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    let mut args = Vec::new();
    let parts: Vec<&str> = input.split("\r\n").collect();

    if parts.is_empty() {
        return args;
    }

    if let Some(count_str) = parts.first().and_then(|s| s.strip_prefix('*')) {
        if let Ok(count) = count_str.parse::<usize>() {
            for i in 0..count {
                if let (Some(len_str), Some(value)) = (parts.get(i * 2 + 1), parts.get(i * 2 + 2)) {
                    if let Some(len_str) = len_str.strip_prefix('$') {
                        if let Ok(len) = len_str.parse::<usize>() {
                            if value.len() == len {
                                args.push(value.to_string());
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    args
}

pub async fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream, db: Db, db_conn: Arc<DbConnection>) {
    let peer_addr = stream.peer_addr().unwrap();
    println!("New connection from {}", peer_addr);
    
    let mut buffer = [0; 1024];
    // Further implementation...
}
```
