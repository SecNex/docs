## Security & Support

SecNex will try to provide support for all scripts in the collection via GitHub issues. Please note that we do not provide any guarantees or warranties for the scripts. Use them at your own risk. This collection is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from the community.

### Vulnerability Reporting

If you find a security vulnerability in any of the scripts, please report it to us via email at [vuln@secnex.io](mailto:vuln@secnex.io). We will try to fix the issue as soon as possible. If we cannot fix the issue, we will remove the script from the collection for security reasons.
