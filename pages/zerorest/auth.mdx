# Authentication

ZeroRest provides a lot of authentication flows to support different scenarios.

## Delegate authentication

Delegate authentication is used when you want to authenticate as a user. This flow is used when you want to access resources on behalf of a user.
You can start the authentication in two modes:

- **Interactive mode**: A browser window will be opened to authenticate the user.
- **Silent mode**: The user will be authenticated silently without any user interaction. This mode is used when you have a refresh token or a windows user token.

## Application authentication

Application authentication is used when you want to authenticate as an application. This flow is used when you want to access resources on behalf of an application.

For this authentication flow, you need to create an application in your tenant (e.g. Azure AD) and grant the necessary permissions to the application. You will also need to create a client secret or a certificate to authenticate the application.

### Parameters

- `client_id`: The client ID of the application.
- `client_secret`: The client secret of the application.
- `tenant_id`: The tenant ID of the application.
- `resource`: The resource you want to access.
